Current version: 1.0

Future Updates Plans: Add an ID to the cell property. Also update the grid change to be dynamic rather than pre-set.

## What is Conway's Game of Life?
This game runs with an algorithm that takes the previous version the current display of the grid and applies the rules to create a new grid which is displayed. That new grid is then put through the algorithm and the process is repeated until the program is stopped.

### Rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead
